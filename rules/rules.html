                <h2>SET-UP</h2>
                <li> Each player places their pieces on the 12 dark squares in
                    the first three rows closest to him or her.</li>
                <li> Each of these three rows should have a total of 4
                    checkers.</li>
                <li>The row closest to each player is called the "King Row".</li>    
                
                <h2>RULES</h2>
                <li> The opponent with the darker pieces moves first.</li>
                
                <li>Pieces may only move one diagonal space forward (towards their opponents pieces) in the
                    beginning of the game.</li>
                <li>Pieces must stay on the dark squares.</li>
                <li>To capture an opposing piece,"jump" over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of
                    the the opposing piece.</li>
                <li>A piece may jump forward over an opponent's pieces in multiple parts of the board to capture
                    them.</li>
                <li>Keep in mind, the space on the other side of your opponentâ€™s piece must be empty for you to
                    capture it.</li>
                <li>If your piece reaches the last row on your opponent's side, you may re-take one of your captured
                    pieces and "crown"the piece that made it to the Kings Row. Thereby making it a "King Piece."</li>
                <li>King pieces may still only move one space at a time during a non-capturing move. However,
                    when capturing an opponent's piece(s) it may move diagonally forward or backwards.</li>
                <li>There is no limit to how many king pieces a player may have.</li>
