            <h2>Ryan </h2>
             My name is Ryan I am from Baltimore MD, moved to PDX two years ago. New to coding but has always enjoyed building PC's, playing video games/ modding video games.
            Might as well jump into coding. In my spare time I like to hike, practice my archery, cook and take care of my Dog Shiva the destroyer. Fun fact I was born with a third front tooth.

            <h2>Ron </h2>
             is secretly a honey badger in disguise. 
            He is a 42 lb drunken, chain-smoking ball of caffeine and coding fury. 
            Taking advantage of open carry laws, he straps a LAW to his back, 
            and a shotgun that fires kittens - extremely angry kittens. 
            He often goes into public without wearing a mask... but when he's forced to, 
            he will wear a chicken wire mesh or a beekeeper's helmet over his snout. 
            Sometimes, he enjoys longs walks on the beach and hikes. 
            His favorite saying is, 'You only live once. But if you live the right way, 
            once is enough. Who wants to live forever, anyway?

            <h2>Patrick </h2>
            has been playing with Checkers pieces since he was in second grade,
            but his first actual game using the game rules wasn't until fourth grade. 
            Playing games is one of his favorite hobbies, 
            and has a history collaborating with other people to make up games. 
            Once he got into coding, he has honed his skills developing a few games.
